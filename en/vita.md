Imagine if Radiohead's frontman Thom Yorke had piano lessons with Bach and Brad Mehldau, and then improvised over Minimal Music with Pharoah Sanders — that's one of the many ways you could describe Martin Zamorano's music.

**Martín Zamorano** (\*1995, Madrid) is a Hamburg-based pianist, composer, and music educator. His artistic identity is shaped by a genre-fluid approach that connects classical roots with jazz tradition, pop culture, folk, and free improvisation. In his music, polyphony, groove, and melancholic lyricism merge into a personal musical language – always seeking emotional depth and artistic integrity.

After receiving a classical piano education at the Conservatorio Arturo Soria in Madrid, he studied Composition (B.Mus.) and Music Theory (M.Mus.) at the Hochschule für Musik und Theater Hamburg, followed by a second master's degree (Dr. Langner Master) in Jazz Performance & Production, where he deepened his work as a pianist and improviser. He is active in Hamburg's music scene – from pop-influenced projects like FiNDiNG CLEO or his folk duo Zamorano & Stamer to avant-garde improvisation in the jazz quartet WARMBLUETIG or the SPIIC ensemble led by Vlatko Kucan. He also collaborates regularly with artists such as Asya Fateyeva, Barry Guy, and Moritz Baumgärtner. In 2023, he founded the ECOllective Ensemble, and in 2024, he co-initiated the experimental label Mental Pocus Records.

His music has been featured at festivals such as Elbjazz, FOLKBaltica, the Bachfest Hamburg, and the Festival for Early Music in Cologne. Awards include a prize at the Leipzig Opera Composition Competition (2019), participation in the Genre-Fluid Composers Lab (New Amsterdam, NY, 2020), and the DAAD Prize for outstanding international students (2021). In the 2025/26 season, he will collaborate for the first time with the Deutsches SchauSpielHaus Hamburg, performing in *Vampire's Mountain*, directed by Philippe Quesne.

Since 2021, he has taught music theory at the Hochschule für Musik Lübeck and, since 2023, piano in popular music at the State Youth Music School in Hamburg. His teaching bridges European classical traditions and jazz with current musical trends – aiming to shape a musically grounded future without neglecting the past.
