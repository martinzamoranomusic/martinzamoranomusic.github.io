Mental Pocus Records is a collaborative space for explorative music, improvisation, sonic poetry and a bit of weird magic. The label is based in Hamburg (Germany) and is curated by Danica Hobden and Martín Zamorano.

The philosophy behind our idea is simple:

- Create a musical space in Hamburg and Germany for young artists that work within the realms of improvised art, regardless of genre, form or language.
- Connect improvisation artists within Hamburg and Europe.
- Share music independently of the financial agendas of the so-called "music industry".
